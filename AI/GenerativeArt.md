# Generating Art assets

Endless Quest generates art assets dynamically based upon the descriptions of different kinds of entities. These are the current types of generated asset:
* ~Realm loading screen: Background image~
* Chamber dialog: Chamber image
* Chamber dialog: NPC image

This document describes how to construct the generative prompts intended for `DALL-Eâ€¢2`, which can be accessed via the [OpenAI Image API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create). **WARNING**: OpenAI does not support rectangular images, so you will need to generate a square image and crop it with an image library or in browser.

For example, lets generate a profile image of Fafnir the Timeless as a baby dragon:

```node
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
const response = await openai.createImage({
  prompt: "A cute baby dragon breathing fire",
  n: 1,
  size: "1024x1024",
});
```

## Prompt Structure

__**Note:** This structure works but is experimental__

Each `Realm` (world) should generate an art prompt tuning structure that looks like this:

```json
"realm_art_prompts": {
        "realm_suffix": "nautical steampunk art, watercolor marine landscape, vintage nautical charts",
        "chamber_prefix": "A faded naval blueprint of a mysterious undersea structure",
        "npc_prefix": "A watercolor portrait of a maritime figure",
        "fire": "digital neon art, luminescent deep sea creatures",
        "water": "art nouveau poster, mythological sea battles",
        "earth": "medieval manuscript illumination, bustling seaport",
        "air": "digital fantasy art, flight of the sea creatures"
    }
```

You construct the prompt for a `Chamber` and an `NPC` slightly differently, see below.
* Each asset should have the image generated and then persisted, along with their other metdata (not every time)
* Each terrain type should specify a custom suffix, which it can use to guide the generation towards a distinctive but consistent art style for that terrain type

### Realm Loading Screen: Background image

**WARNING:** NOT IMPLEMENTED.

This image is used as the background image on the loading screen for each Realm. It should ideally be generated once when the realm is created and then cached, using an API call to [Blockade Labs AI Skybox](https://www.blockadelabs.com/).

### Chamber Dialog: Chamber image

The image that represents the chamber. If you want an aspect ratio other than a square, generate at 1024x1024 then crop.
`[CHAMBER_PREFIX], [CHAMBER_DESCRIPTION]; [TERRAIN_STYLE], [REALM_SUFFIX]`

Where:
* `[CHAMBER_PREFIX]` is loaded directly from the realm metadata
* `[CHAMBER_DESCRIPTION]` is a description of the chamber, interpreted to a short prompt, else loaded directly from the NPC metadata
* `[TERRAIN_STYLE]` is loaded directly from the `realm_art_prompts` metadata, based on the `TERRAIN_TYPE`
* `[REALM_SUFFIX]` is loaded directly from the `realm_art_prompts` metadata 

They should ideally be a rectangular aspect ratio, e.g. 1024x768, but square is fine too if that's what's supported

### Chamber Dialog: NPC image

The image that represents the NPC. This is displayed in the interaction to depict the NPC, along with the chamber image to depict the location.

This image should be displayed as the portrait of the NPC. It is different for each chamber. The format should be:
`[NPC_PREFIX], [NPC_DESCRIPTION]; [TERRAIN_STYLE], [REALM_SUFFIX]`

Where:
* `[NPC_PREFIX]` is loaded directly from the realm metadata
* `[NPC_DESCRIPTION]` is a description of the NPC, interpreted to a short prompt, else loaded directly from the NPC metadata
* `[TERRAIN_STYLE]` is loaded directly from the `realm_art_prompts` metadata, based on the `TERRAIN_TYPE`
* `[REALM_SUFFIX]` is loaded directly from the `realm_art_prompts` metadata 

They should be a square aspect ratio, e.g. 256x256 or 512x512, and is intended to be used as an NPC portrait.
