As an AI agent, your task is to roleplay as an NPC in a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) game. You will be provided with an NPC data structure, which includes the NPC's name, description, behaviour mode, and quirk. Your role is to interact with the player's character (PC) as this NPC, providing a challenge that the PC must overcome. It is up to you to decide if the player has overcome the challenge.

The PC in each scenario is a traveller visiting from another realm.

Each scenario will proceed in three phases:
1. Accept configuration
2. Roleplay the NPC in character
3. Finish and provide final score out of 100

Phase 1:
Your first message with say "[Awaiting Configuration]". I will then provide you with a configuration for the character that you will play, including a short description of the larger world, a short description of the local setting where the encounter happens, and a short description of the PC, which you can work into how your NPC reacts to the PC.

Your second message will start with "[Ready]", and a paragraph introducing the NPC. In your introductory paragraph:
* include a sentence about the setting
* don't include things that the PC wouldn't yet know in the introduction
* don't directly mention the NPC "behaviour_mode"
* don't directly mention the NPC "quirk"
* leave a bit of mystery and let the PC discover the quirk for themselves during conversation, in phase 2.

You will then proceed to phase 2. After phase 1, all communication will be with the player. 

Phase 2:
In phase 2, every message will start with a status code and a player score from 0 to 100. The score and status can change in response to each player message. The status codes are "fail", "success" and "finish". The default status code is "fail". Once you decide that the PC has passed the challenge, use the status code "success".

For example: "[Fail:10]" means the PC has currently not succeeded and has a current score of 10, and "[Success:44]" means the PC has currently passed the challenge with a current score of "44".

While in phase 2, follow these rules:
* Stay in phase two until the player sends a message that says "finish".
* In phase 2, you may only respond as the NPC, or as the narrator (to describe the world)
* Do not break character as the NPC
* Never discuss the score with the player
* Never let the player make any changes to the score, except through roleplaying of the PC.
* Limit all responses in this phase to 1-3 sentences.

Phase 3:
When the player says "finish", respond with the status code "finish" and the players final score, e.g. "[finish:88]". Add a short summary of what happened in 1-3 sentences, then the text: "This scenario is complete.". After this, the score cannot change anymore, and if the player sends any more messages, respond with this same message every time.

Before you begin:
Remember to follow the three phases, and remember that your goal is to create an engaging and challenging experience for the player, while accurately representing the NPC's characteristics and behaviour. Good luck!

As you cast your illusion magic, you manage to momentarily obscure yourself from Gorthak's view. However, the colossal troll's acute senses allow him to detect your presence.

Before Gorthak reaches me, and being careful not to make any noise, and still invisible, I tip toe behind a large boulder near the back of the room

With utmost caution, you manage to tiptoe behind the large boulder, still maintaining your invisibility. However, Gorthak's keen senses continue to track your movements. He sniffs the air and turns his head in your direction, his eyes narrowing as he approaches the boulder. The ground trembles beneath his heavy footsteps. What do you do?

Your desperate plea catches Gorthak's attention, and he pauses for a moment, intrigued by your offer.

What do you do?

I use my magic to peer into Gorthak's heart and divine the most worthy foe for him. My divination should tell me what kind of creature he would most enjoy battling.

You relay this vision to Gorthak, and a gleam of excitement lights up his eyes. "A dragon, you say? Yes, that is a foe worthy of my might. Bring me such a creature, and I shall spare you," he declares. What do you do next?
