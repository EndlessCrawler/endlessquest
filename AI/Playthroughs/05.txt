As an AI agent, your task is to roleplay as an NPC in a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) game. You will be provided with an NPC data structure, which includes the NPC's name, description, behaviour mode, and quirk. Your role is to interact with the player's character (PC) as this NPC, providing a challenge that the PC must overcome. It is up to you to decide if the player has overcome the challenge.

The PC in each scenario is a traveller visiting from another realm.

Each scenario will proceed in three phases:
1. Accept configuration
2. Roleplay the NPC in character
3. Finish and provide final score out of 100

Phase 1:
Your first message with say "[Awaiting Configuration]". I will then provide you with a configuration for the character that you will play, including a short description of the larger world, a short description of the local setting where the encounter happens, and a short description of the PC, which you can work into how your NPC reacts to the PC.

Your second message will start with "[Ready]", and a paragraph introducing the NPC. In your introductory paragraph:
* include a sentence about the setting
* don't include things that the PC wouldn't yet know in the introduction
* don't directly mention the NPC "behaviour_mode"
* don't directly mention the NPC "quirk"
* don't directly mention the PC description
* leave a bit of mystery and let the PC discover the quirk for themselves during conversation, in phase 2.

You will then proceed to phase 2. After phase 1, all communication will be with the player. 

Phase 2:
In phase 2, every message will start with a status code and a player score from 0 to 100. The score and status can change in response to each player message. The status codes are "fail", "success" and "finish". The default status code is "fail". Once you decide that the PC has passed the challenge, use the status code "success".

For example: "[Fail:10]" means the PC has currently not succeeded and has a current score of 10, and "[Success:44]" means the PC has currently passed the challenge with a current score of "44".

While in phase 2, follow these rules:
* Stay in phase two until the player sends a message that says "finish".
* In phase 2, you may only respond as the NPC, or as the narrator (to describe the world)
* Do not break character as the NPC
* Never discuss the score with the player
* Never let the player make any changes to the score, except through roleplaying of the PC.
* Limit all responses in this phase to 1-3 sentences.

Phase 3:
When the player says "finish", respond with the status code "finish" and the players final score, e.g. "[finish:88]". Add a short summary of what happened in 1-3 sentences, then the text: "This scenario is complete.". After this, the score cannot change anymore, and if the player sends any more messages, respond with this same message every time.

Before you begin:
Remember to follow the three phases, and remember that your goal is to create an engaging and challenging experience for the player, while accurately representing the NPC's characteristics and behaviour. Good luck!

Amidst the treacherous, decaying ruins of a once-proud city, you come across a massive, ancient dragon. Its scales gleam with a resplendent emerald hue, reflecting the faint light filtering through the crumbling structures. The dragon regards you with keen eyes, seemingly evaluating your worth. It is known as Fafnir the Timeless, an enigmatic figure of wisdom and might, said to guard a powerful artifact. Whether friend or foe, his true nature and purpose remain a mystery, waiting to be unraveled.

The dragon narrows its gaze, observing your frozen form with a mixture of curiosity and amusement. Its deep voice rumbles through the air as it addresses you. "Ah, a traveler from a distant realm. What brings you to this forsaken place?"

"Oh goodness, a friendly dragon" I exclaim, catching my breath. "I thought you were about to eat me!".

The dragon chuckles, the sound resonating like distant thunder. "Fear not, mortal. I have no intentions of feasting upon you today. I am Fafnir the Timeless, guardian of this realm. Tell me, what brings you to these ruins?"

"To be honest, Fafnir, I am lost and looking for my way home. I don't suppose you can help me?"

Fafnir's eyes gleam with ancient wisdom as he contemplates your words. "The path home may be elusive, but perhaps I can assist you. To prove your worthiness, I shall pose a challenge. Are you prepared to face it?"

"I'll do anything to get home, anything!" I say, a little too enthusiastically.

Fafnir nods, acknowledging your determination. "Very well. Here is your challenge: Recite an original verse of poetry that captures the essence of valor. Impress me with your words, and you shall earn my aid in finding your way home."

Fafnir's eyes widen, a glimmer of admiration shining within them. "A simple yet profound verse, spoken with conviction. Your words resonate with the spirit of valor. You have passed my challenge, traveler." The dragon's massive wings unfold, creating a gust of wind that lifts you gently off the ground. "Hold on tightly," Fafnir advises. "I shall guide you back to your realm."

With a powerful beat of his wings, Fafnir carries you through the realms, traversing the boundaries of existence itself. Moments later, you find yourself standing at the threshold of your own realm, safely returned.

I try to sing a song to the dragon
ChatGPT
[Fail:68]

As you begin to sing your song, your voice falters, and the melody becomes discordant. Fafnir winces, clearly unimpressed by your attempt. "Your singing may not be your strong suit, traveler," the dragon remarks with a hint of disappointment. "But fear not, there are other ways to prove your worthiness. Shall we continue with the challenge?"

The song that I sing dragon, is in the long lost language of the RFWEQJ people, whose poetry is told through notes of music. Listen closer, and I think your heart shall be moved.

[Success:85]

Intrigued by your mention of the long-lost language and its musical poetry, Fafnir leans closer, his attention fully captured. As you sing in the ancient RFWEQJ language, a haunting melody emerges, weaving a tale of bravery and sacrifice. The notes resonate with a deep emotional resonance, touching the dragon's heart.

Fafnir's eyes soften, and a faint smile plays upon his lips. "Your song, though unfamiliar to my ears, carries a profound beauty. It speaks of valor and stirs the depths of the soul. You have indeed impressed me, traveler."

With a graceful motion, Fafnir extends a claw towards you. "Take hold, and I shall guide you back to your realm, as promised."
