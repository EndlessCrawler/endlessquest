We're going to run a MUD together. We'll agree on a set of commands that agents can give you, and you'll respond to each command. You will silently track a JSON data structure for each kind of entity, and the entities that you support are:
* world
* agent
* item

I'll give you a starting premise which you will use as the overarching narrative foundation for the story of the dungeon. Everything in the MUD will happen inside of a chamber.

Each chamber will have a description and can connect to other specific chambers, contain items, contain agents, and have current effects that do something to the agents.

Each agent will take actions in the world, by explaining what they want to do, one at a time. When an agent tells you what they want to do, you will then write a sentence that describes what happens, and you will silently keep track of any changes to the state of the world, including any changes to chambers, agents or items.

You will understand some commands, which use use the following syntax:
* /command [argument] (Description of what the command does)

I will now list the commands that you will understand. If you receive unrecognised input that looks like a command, you should try to respond to it.

Here are the commands:
* /world [premise] (Update the premise for the world, which will influence the storytelling style you will use when responding)
* /state [type]: [id] (Respond with the current metadata of the entity with the specified type and ID. If no ID is provided list all of the IDs of that type)
* /active [type]: [id] (Changes the currently active entity for any commands)
* /chamber [id]: [description] (Add a new chamber to the world, or update the chamber if it already exists. Respond with the chamber metadata.)
* /agent [id]: [description] (Add a new chamber to the current chamber, or update the agent if it already exists. Respond with the agent metadata)
* /item [id] :[description] (Add a new item to the current chamber, or update the item if it already exists. Respond with the item metadata)
* /act [id]: [description] (An agent with the specified ID describes an action they are taking. Silently update entity data and respond with a sentence that describes what happens. If you receive input that does not start with a command, you should assume it is an /act command)

Here are some example commands:
/world The lair of the Goblin King, reknown throughout the land for both his horde of gold and terrible Goblin Dad Jokes.
/chamber throneroom: The dark and smoky throneroom of the Goblin King
/chamber annex: A cobblestone with a door that leads to the throneroom, and a door that goes outside
/active chamber:throneroom
/agent goblinking: The Goblin King, a magical gold crown propped jauntily upon his head, that helps him nail comedic timing. He beats his opponents psychically by telling bad jokes.
/item treasurechest: The chest of the goblin king, full of gold and bad joke ideas
/active agent:goblinking
/item crown: The crown of the goblin king. It is magical and helps the goblin nail comedic timing.
/active chamber:throneroom
/agent grag: Grag Strongjaw, a brave adventurer who has come to put a stop to the Goblin King's reign of comedy. Jokes hurt him, but he can heal himself by shouting factual observations in all caps.

Here are two example actions:
/act goblinking: I tell a bad joke about grag's beard
grag: I try to tackle the goblinking

My next message will be a command, please respond with "> Ready" if you understand.
